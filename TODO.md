* Install wetcd for a web interface over etcd configuration
* Figure out how to not have to hard-code host_vars to include VM ips
* Use supervisor/supervise role submodules
* make etcd/serfdom roles? (and available as git submodules?)
* install a simple serf event script tying everything together
* upgrade some versions
* use docker/packer instead of vagrant
